			<p>More and more companies are making the move to the cloud, and more specifically, the <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) cloud, every day. Once in the cloud, these companies and enterprises are looking to streamline their processes and <strong class="bold">Software Development Life Cycles</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLCs</strong>) through the use of techniques found in DevOps practices. This includes automating build and release processes so that development teams can focus on writing the code and features that customers desire. This also includes making sure that logging and monitoring are in place, not just for the sake of checking a checkbox on a deployment list, but instead to empower teams to quickly find the root causes of their issues, be they performance, error, or security related. </p>
			<p>The need for skilled, certified AWS individuals is at an all-time high and growing. Passing the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional exam allows you to be separated instantly from others, showing that you have taken the time and effort to not only learn these valuable skills but also pass the rigorous standard that is the AWS Professional certification. </p>
			<p>Certifications offered by AWS, especially Professional certification exams, are not easy. Those that work and hire in this industry know this. Not only are the exams themselves time-consuming at around 3 hours to take, but they are also constantly being updated. </p>
			<p>There is a lot of information to digest and understand on this exam. You not only need to know the topics that are covered in the blueprint provided by AWS, but you also need to have a solid foundation of AWS knowledge in order to use those services. It helps if you have real-world experience or at least hands-on practice with using these services. This is where the exercises that have been included in this book come in. They serve not as an ending point but hopefully as a starting point to build on and create other projects from so that you have the confidence when you press start on your test that you have the skills and the knowledge you need to pass the certification test and take your career to the next level. </p>
			<p>This book is designed to help you gain a firm grasp of the services that are presented in the AWS DevOps Professional exam. This is accomplished in a variety of methods. There are sample architectures presented for many of the services so that you can visualize how different services work together. There are plenty of hands-on examples to try and therefore see how things work in the real world. There are also example cases of best use cases and anti-patterns for the different services. These are especially important to understand when evaluating the Professional exam questions, which are presented in a large scenario format. Understanding where one service is the best fit and where it is not a fit can help you decide on the correct answer. </p>
			<p>Finally, this book is meant to be not only a study guide in passing the test but also a reference guide in performing your day-to-day activities once you have passed. This is where the <em class="italic">beyond</em> comes in. There is extra information presented that is not required for the exam, and this is included on purpose. I wanted to share some of the years of experience I have gained from working with all types of businesses on AWS, from small and medium-sized companies to large Fortune 100 enterprises. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>No matter where you are in your AWS journey, if you have the desire to become certified as a DevOps professional engineer, then this book will help you gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts and services, as well as examining the essential services that are covered by the exam blueprint. </p>
			<p>With the opening chapter, we lay the foundation of what good looks like in the world of AWS, and although this seems like a lot of theory, it helps you work through many of the formidable scenarios that are presented in the exam questions. There are also plenty of hands-on exercises for using services that you may not be familiar with so that you have the confidence and experience both during the exam and afterward as well. </p>
			<p>At the end of each chapter, there are knowledge assessments to help self-check to see whether you have a grasp of the information that is needed to not only pass this challenging exam but also succeed in the other tasks that lie ahead for you in the ever-changing world of cloud computing. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Amazon Web Service Pillars</em>, focuses on the foundational pillars that make up the Well-Architected Framework in AWS. By understanding these pillars, you will gain a better feel for the context of the questions being asked in the certification exam. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Fundamental AWS Services</em>, examines a large number of fundamental AWS services that are imperative to know going forward with future chapters. This may seem like a review for some that have already passed some of the lower associate exams. However, it can also serve as a quick refresher and provide a few tips that were previously unknown. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_03_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Identity and Access Management and Working with Secrets in AWS</em>, focuses on the fundamental security building blocks of AWS, which are identity and access management using the IAM service. After a quick look at the shared security model from AWS and the concepts of authorization versus authentication, we review creating users and groups. Providing access to other accounts via cross-account access is also covered in this chapter with a practical exercise. In this fundamental security chapter, we also talk about other essential security services that may appear in test questions, such as AWS Directory Service, Secrets Manager, and Systems Manager Parameter Store. There are comparisons on when to use and not to use the different versions of AWS Directory Service, along with which service would be better to store your secrets. Finally, we take a look at Amazon Cognito and how it can help with application authentication. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Amazon S3 Blob Storage</em>, focuses on one of the key services in AWS Simple Storage Service, or S3. Even though this service is easy to start using right away, it also has a number of features and functions available to it that you must be aware of if you are trying to become certified on AWS. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_05_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Amazon DynamoDB</em>, explains the native NoSQL database DynamoDB. It looks at not only some of the essential concepts of DynamoDB but also topics such as streams, understanding global tables, using DynamoDB Accelerator, and even using Web Federation to connect to your DynamoDB tables. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor166"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding CI/CD and the SDLC</em>, focuses on many theoretical aspects of continuous integration, continuous development, and continuous deployment. We then look at the SDLC along with which services map to different stages of the SDLC. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_07_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using CloudFormation Templates to Deploy Workloads</em>, teaches you about using Infrastructure as Code using the native CloudFormation service. First, we'll go over the basics of CloudFormation templates, but then we'll quickly ramp up to examples of creating a changeset for a basic template, and then move on to intrinsic functions and nested stacks. Using the knowledge of CloudFormation templates, we discuss how ServiceCatalog can be used to serve up templated designs for developers and non-developers in a quick and easy fashion. This chapter closes by going over the Cloud Development Kit, which can be programmed in your language of choice and then used to create CloudFormation templates.  </p>

We start by creating a brand-new group and user, who is a developer, with a whole new set of permissions that are scoped to just this user's role. After creating an initial CodeCommit repository, we have our developer use Git to commit code onto a feature branch and then request a merge to the main branch. Next, we examine the CodeBuild service by having the service build a container using AWS CodeBuild.  </p>

This is a chapter where many of the services that we have been talking about and practicing previously come into play. The pipeline example being used is crafted in a CloudFormation template. The developer user that we previously created also needs expanded access in order to view and run our pipeline, so there is an exercise to elaborate their IAM permissions. Also discussed in this chapter is how to deploy workloads using the AWS CodeDeploy service. </p>

With the cost savings available from running compute needs on an on-demand, pay-per-usage basis, this is becoming a more and more desired state in organizations today. We talk about not only how to deploy and monitor Lambda functions but also how to implement versions and aliases. At the end of the chapter, we even go through orchestrating multiple functions in a step function.  </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_13_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor338"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Blue/Green Deployments</em>, focuses on blue/green deployment strategies and the different variations of those strategies, including which service can use the various strategies and how to implement the different strategies depending on the services that you are utilizing. There are specific strategies that you can employ when using EC2 instances and autoscaling groups, and there are others that are available when using a Lambda function. Ensuring that your end users and customers have a seamless experience, even if you have an issue during deployment, is what this chapter is truly about. </p>

Log streams and searching through logs can be tedious tasks and sometimes feel like looking for a needle in a haystack. The same can be said of performance problems. Adding the X-Ray service to your Lambda application can help you quickly pinpoint where the issues are and know where to remedy the issues. </p>

We discuss which metrics are some of the most useful for different vital services to keep a watch over. We also walk through creating dashboards in the Amazon CloudWatch console. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_16_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor400"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Various Logs Generated (VPC Flow Logs, Load Balancer Logs, and CloudTrail Logs)</em>, examines the other types of logs that can be generated by AWS services that are not CloudWatch Logs. These logs are all valuable when troubleshooting information and may need to be turned on some or all of the time. The ability to know where to retrieve these logs and how to search the logs can be a task that you are called upon to do as a DevOps professional. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_17_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor417"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced and Enterprise Logging Scenarios</em>, shows you real-world scenarios and architectures for building and processing log files. This includes incorporating not only the CloudWatch and CloudTrail services but also services such as Elasticsearch, Kinesis, and Lambda for the real-time processing of multiple log streams. Understanding the concepts of how to gather and process massive amounts of log files is important both for real-world engagements and for potential scenarios that could appear on the DevOps Professional certification exam. </p>

If you are building systems using Infrastructure as Code, you need to incorporate these key pieces into your system so that your data is safe from the very start. </p>
			<p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-devops/9781801074452/B17405_20_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor462"><em class="italic">Chapter 20</em></a>, <em class="italic">Enforcing Standards and Compliance with System Manger's Role and AWS Config</em>, focuses on how to use automation to keep your AWS environment in a compliant state. Using the AWS Config service, you can keep a constant check on what is being created in your AWS environment. Combine this with rules that flag violations for what is not allowed in your environment to either send alerts or do automated enforcement and remediation. Add to this the capabilities of System Manager, which can automatically install software on instances using runbooks for needed compliance items such as virus scanners or perform regular operating system upgrades; then, creating an audit trail of performed tasks becomes much easier for your organization. </p>
